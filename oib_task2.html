          <h2>Covid Detection and Epidemic Outbreak Prediction Using ML</h2>
          <p>
            In my third year of engineering we built this project : Covid Detection and Epidemic Outbreak Prediction Using ML involves leveraging <br/>machine learning algorithms to identify and diagnose COVID-19 cases through data analysis of symptoms, test results, and other relevant factors. <br/>
            Additionally, it enables the early detection and forecasting of epidemic outbreaks,<br/> 
            allowing healthcare systems to proactively respond to potential surges and implement timely containment measures.
